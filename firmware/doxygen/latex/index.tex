 This firmware runs on the Chromation dev-\/kit\+:

\href{https://microspectrometer.github.io/dev-kit-2020/}{\texttt{ https\+://microspectrometer.\+github.\+io/dev-\/kit-\/2020/}}

The dev-\/kit has two ATmega328 microcontrollers and a spectrometer chip.

This firmware is for the Flash memory in the two microcontrollers. There is no firmware for the spectrometer chip itself, but the chip does have programmable registers which must be written to after power is turned on.

\doxysubsection*{Spectrometer chip programmable registers}

The spectrometer chip has programmable registers that affect pixel size and voltage gain. The dev-\/kit writes these registers with Chromation\textquotesingle{}s recommended values when the dev-\/kit is powered on.

Most applications do not require changing these register values. But in case there is a special use-\/case where it makes sense to change these values, the Python API in {\ttfamily microspec} (defined in \href{https://github.com/microspectrometer/microspec/blob/master/cfg/microspec.json}{\texttt{ microspec.\+json}}) includes command {\ttfamily set\+Sensor\+Config()} to write to these registers.

\doxysection*{Serial communication and the Python API}

This firmware was created to work with Py\+PI project {\ttfamily microspec}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ pip install microspec}

\end{DoxyCode}


The Python code in {\ttfamily microspec} is auto-\/generated from the serial communication protocol defined in the \href{https://github.com/microspectrometer/microspec/blob/master/cfg/microspec.json}{\texttt{ microspec.\+json file}}

The firmware was written (manually) to comply with this protocol.
