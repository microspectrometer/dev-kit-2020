This firmware works with Py\+PI project {\ttfamily microspec}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ pip install microspec}
\end{DoxyCode}


The firmware follows the protocol defined in the \href{https://github.com/microspectrometer/microspec/blob/master/cfg/microspec.json}{\texttt{ microspec.\+json file}}

\doxysection*{Chromation Spectrometer dev-\/kit}

The Chromation spectrometer is a surface-\/mount P\+CB package consisting of a linear photodiode array and optical components. This spectrometer chip does not contain any firmware.

The firmware is on the two microcontrollers in the dev-\/kit. The dev-\/kit has a stack of two P\+C\+Bs, with one microcontroller on each.

The microcontroller on the lower P\+CB provides a S\+PI interface to the Chromation spectrometer. The microcontroller on the upper P\+CB converts the S\+PI interface into a U\+SB interface.

The dev-\/kit helps users evaluate the spectrometer chip. Also, all of the dev-\/kit files, including this firmware, are available to users under the M\+IT license, meaning reuse in commercial and non-\/commercial projects with very little limitation.

\doxysubsection*{Programmable registers}

The spectrometer chip has programmable registers that affect pixel size and voltage gain. The dev-\/kit writes these registers with Chromation\textquotesingle{}s recommended values when the dev-\/kit is powered on.

Developers typically do not need to change these register values. The Python A\+PI in {\ttfamily microspec} (defined in \href{https://github.com/microspectrometer/microspec/blob/master/cfg/microspec.json}{\texttt{ microspec.\+json}}) includes command {\ttfamily set\+Sensor\+Config()} to write to these registers, in case developers have a special use-\/case.
