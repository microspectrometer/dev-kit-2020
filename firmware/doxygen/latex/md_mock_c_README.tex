\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md125}{}\doxysubsection{Compiling mock-\/c}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md125}
Your project\textquotesingle{}s build script ({\ttfamily Makefile}) builds the {\ttfamily mock-\/c} object files like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{CFLAGS := -\/I/usr/include/glib-\/2.0 -\/I/usr/lib/glib-\/2.0/include}
\DoxyCodeLine{}

\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc -\/c \$< -\/o \$@ \$(CFLAGS)}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape The context is that your test runner executable links with mock-\/c object files (I\textquotesingle{}ll show a recipe for that later). The recipe above tells {\ttfamily make} how to create those files in the {\ttfamily ../mock-\/c/build/} folder if they don\textquotesingle{}t exist (and they won\textquotesingle{}t exist when you first clone this repository).}

I explain how to read this recipe so you can achieve the same goal with build tools other than {\ttfamily make} and {\ttfamily gcc}.

\doxysubsubsection*{Reading Makefile recipes}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target: pre-\/requisites}
\DoxyCodeLine{    action}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily target} is whatever needs to get made
\item {\ttfamily pre-\/requisites} are a list of files
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily make} rebuilds {\ttfamily target} if it is older than any of the {\ttfamily pre-\/requisites}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily action} is whatever needs to get done (e.\+g., compile a {\ttfamily .c} into a {\ttfamily .o})
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast${\ttfamily action} uses symbols {\ttfamily \$$<$} and {\ttfamily \$@}$\ast$


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target: pre-\/requisites}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc -\/c \$< -\/o \$@ \$(CFLAGS)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    └──────────┬────────────┘}
\DoxyCodeLine{               │}
\DoxyCodeLine{            action}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \$$<$} -- the {\bfseries{first}} file in the list of {\ttfamily pre-\/requisites}
\item {\ttfamily \$$^\wedge$} -- {\bfseries{all}} the files in the list of {\ttfamily pre-\/requisites}
\item {\ttfamily \$@} -- the {\ttfamily target}
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast${\ttfamily target} and {\ttfamily pre-\/requisites} use symbol {\ttfamily \%}$\ast$


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{  target───┐  pre-\/requisites ──┐}
\DoxyCodeLine{           │                   │}
\DoxyCodeLine{           │  ┌────────────────┴─────┐}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/\%.o: ../code/\%.c ../code/\%.h}

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily \%} captures the {\bfseries{stem}}, thereby generalizing this for all of the {\ttfamily ../mock-\/c/build/} object files.

For example, if {\ttfamily ../mock-\/c/build/\+Mock.o} does not exist, {\ttfamily make} finds the above recipe because it matches the pattern {\ttfamily ../mock-\/c/build/\%.o}.

In this example, the {\bfseries{stem}} is {\ttfamily Mock}, so when make needs to create {\ttfamily Mock.\+o}, it expands the recipe into this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{../mock-\/c/build/Mock.o: ../mock-\/c/code/Mock.c ../mock-\/c/code/Mock.h ../mock-\/c/code/unity\_internals.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc -\/c ../mock-\/c/code/Mock.c -\/o ../mock-\/c/build/Mock.o -\/I/usr/include/glib-\/2.0 -\/I/usr/lib/glib-\/2.0/include}

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily CFLAGS} are in addition to whatever compiler flags your build script already has. The example only shows the compiler flags necessary to compile {\bfseries{mock-\/c}}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{CFLAGS := -\/I/usr/include/glib-\/2.0 -\/I/usr/lib/glib-\/2.0/include}

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily -\/Ipath} flag tells the compiler where to search for header files, so the above tells the compiler where to find your computer\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily glib} headers. I detail how to install {\bfseries{GLib}} and how to determine these flags \href{README.md\#glib}{\texttt{ later}}. The {\ttfamily -\/Ipath} flags in the example above show the default POSIX install path for {\bfseries{GLib}}.

The {\bfseries{mock-\/c}} source code has {\ttfamily \#include $<$glib.\+h$>$}, but this repository does not include {\bfseries{GLib}} source code and does not include pre-\/compiled {\bfseries{GLib}} libraries. I treat {\ttfamily glib.\+h} as a system header, so these {\ttfamily -\/I} flags are necessary for the compiler to find the {\bfseries{GLib}} headers on your system.\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md126}{}\doxysubsection{Linking mock-\/c}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md126}
Unit test code will {\ttfamily \#include $<$mock-\/c.\+h$>$}. Tell the compiler where to search for this header file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/I../mock-\/c/code}

\end{DoxyCode}


The test runner executable links with the {\bfseries{mock-\/c}} object files. Tell the linker where to search for these object files\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/L../mock-\/c/build}

\end{DoxyCode}

\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md133}{}\doxysubsection{Building up the Makefile for unit tests}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md133}
{\ttfamily unity.\+o} builds quickly. If there are no other object files to link, then there is no need for conditional builds. So the Makefile would boil down to one recipe\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/test\_runner.exe: test\_runner.c ../code/unity.c ../code/unity.h ../code/unity\_internals.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc \$(CFLAGS) test\_runner.c ../code/unity.c -\/o \$@ \$(LFLAGS)}

\end{DoxyCode}


But once there are several object files to link, the build goes much faster if the object files do not have to rebuild every time (based on my experience using {\ttfamily gcc} in Cygwin).

So the {\ttfamily make} recipe splits into two recipes\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/test\_runner.exe: test\_runner.c ../build/unity.o}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc \$(CFLAGS) \$\string^ -\/o \$@ \$(LFLAGS)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/unity.o: ../code/unity.c ../code/unity.h ../code/unity\_internals.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc -\/c \$< -\/o \$@ \$(LFLAGS)}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape I explained earlier \href{README.md\#reading-makefile-recipes}{\texttt{ what the cryptic symbols mean}}.}

The first recipe says\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+exe} depends on {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+c} and on the pre-\/compiled object file {\ttfamily ../build/unity.o}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The idea is that the {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+c} file is changing as tests are edited, but the source files in the compilation unit for {\ttfamily unity.\+o} are not going to change often.

Therefore, there is no point rebuilding {\ttfamily unity.\+o} every time {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+exe} is built. {\ttfamily unity.\+o} is only rebuilt if any of the {\ttfamily unity} source files change. And if that happens, {\ttfamily make} detects that {\ttfamily unity.\+o} is out-\/of-\/date and rebuilds {\ttfamily unity.\+o} before building {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+exe}.

This is captured in the second recipe\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item build {\ttfamily unity.\+o} by compiling {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{unity_8c_source}{unity.\+c}}}
\item the trigger to rebuild {\ttfamily unity.\+o} is to check if {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{unity_8c_source}{unity.\+c}}} or either of its header files change.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The point of splitting into two recipes is that there are several object files, not just {\ttfamily unity.\+o}. To handle any object file, the second recipe turns into this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/\%.o: ../code/\%.c ../code/unity.h ../code/unity\_internals.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gcc -\/c \$< -\/o \$@ \$(CFLAGS)}

\end{DoxyCode}


The idea is that {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+exe} is built by linking {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner.\+o} with {\itshape many} object files, not just {\ttfamily unity.\+o}. This revised recipe is generalized for making a {\ttfamily foo.\+o} in the {\ttfamily build} folder from any {\ttfamily foo.\+c} in the {\ttfamily code} folder. If changes to a header file should trigger a rebuild, those header files get added to the list of prerequisites.

Finally, here is the actual make recipe for the unit tests that test {\ttfamily mock-\/c}. There are several object files to link with and the \char`\"{}main\char`\"{} source code is divided into several files.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{../build/test\_runner.exe: test\_runner.c ExampleCalls.c test\_ExampleCalls.c \(\backslash\)}

To \char`\"{}mock\char`\"{} a function is to stub it with a {\bfseries{fake}} version that records when (in the call order) it was called and what arguments it was called with.\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md135}{}\doxysubsection{TDD terminology}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md135}
TDD (Test Driven Development) is a rabbit-\/hole, so instead of expecting you to look this stuff up and reconcile contradictory definitions, I will just say what I mean when I use these words {\itshape stub}, {\itshape fake}, and {\itshape mock}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\itshape stub} replaces a function with a dummy version that still compiles but has zero functionality. This is what I use 99\% of the time. The common use case is testing a function that calls functions that wait on the embedded hardware.
\item A {\itshape fake} is a {\itshape stub} that adds fake functionality for the purposes of the test, for example giving the unit test control over the value returned by the function so that the unit test can test a scenario where the function returns a particular value. The return value is \char`\"{}faked\char`\"{}.
\item A {\itshape mock} is where the fake functionality is to record how the function was called. And maybe it does other fake functionality too, like the return value thing. This kind of fake gets a special name simply because {\bfseries{it\textquotesingle{}s more difficult to implement this particular fake functionality}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

TLDR\+: Mocking is for the {\itshape small} subset of unit tests where the goal is to check whether the function under test is calling other functions and calling them with the correct arguments.\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md136}{}\doxysubsection{Reinventing wheels}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md136}
How do you implement mocking? People do lots of complicated things to mock functions. Everything I found was too complicated for me to get it working. So I came up with my own way.

The mocks record themselves in a global list setup by the test suite (the test suite is the application that calls all the unit tests). This global list is erased before each unit test.

When the function under test calls fake functions, the fake function writes its name and its arguments to the global list. The test is to compare the expected list of calls against what was recorded in the global list and identify where something unexpected happened.\hypertarget{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md137}{}\doxysubsection{Avoid mocking as much as possible}\label{md_mock_c_README_autotoc_md137}
In practice, the source code definition of the function under test gets bracketed with macros that rename functions with a {\ttfamily Fake} suffix. {\bfseries{Those macros add noise to the source code.}}

It\textquotesingle{}s possible to eliminate these macros using function pointers, and that is exactly how {\bfseries{mock-\/c}} started out. But when speed matters, the function pointer approach adds extra operations to load the function. Speed matters in embedded systems. I think it\textquotesingle{}s a mistake to sacrifice speed in support of 100\% unit test coverage (i.\+e., if every function used a function pointer because every function was mocked because that\textquotesingle{}s the only way to true 100\% test coverage). Furthermore, in my particular case writing C for 8-\/bit AVR microcontrollers, the function pointer approach prevented {\bfseries{avr-\/gcc}} from choosing the optimal assembly instructions.

{\bfseries{Mocking also generates a lot of extra code (i.\+e, project code that is not running on the target)}}. This extra code takes time to maintain. When the function\textquotesingle{}s argument types change, the definition of the fake needs to change, and all the tests that are checking the arguments needs to change. The main benefit of TDD is that it {\itshape lowers} the barrier to changing code. So if hitting 100\% test coverage means I\textquotesingle{}m more hesitant to change the code (because of this enormous ripple effect throughout the tests), then it defeats the main reason for doing TDD in the first place.
