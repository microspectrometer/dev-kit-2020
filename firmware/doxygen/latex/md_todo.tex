\mbox{[} \mbox{]} 2020-\/06-\/29 Nadia received Focuz batch of failed smt builds
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item not sending to get assembled\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item die to detector spacing will be different
\item builds are bad
\item no point
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item but a new set of 6 was sent by Fed-\/\+Ex this morning
\item want to get these assembled
\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{[} \mbox{]} discuss Joshua Pearce Friday\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item review their two application areas (not plastic) to be ready to help them get up and running
\item 90-\/aoa die -- turn 45 into 90 with a mirror
\item maybe a live demo? they may want 90, but still be able to start with 45 as a proxy if 90 is not ready (e.\+g., to get software up and running) \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} fix system-\/tests.\+py to match new protocol \mbox{[} \mbox{]} rebuild documentation \mbox{[} \mbox{]} rename package and modules \mbox{[} \mbox{]} upload to Py\+Pi \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} make kitnum works \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} make progkitnum works (but not from Vim) \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} make help-\/flash \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} make fuses \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} make flash
\item had to add avr-\/gcc as the default definition of compiler
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} help\+: include set compiler name to gcc for unit tests
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} come up with a way to make the build folders if they do not exist, and do this silently as part of a first attempt at {\ttfamily make flash}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item my workaround for now is to put files called {\ttfamily empty} in each of the build folders to force git to track these otherwise empty folders
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{[} \mbox{]} clean up common.\+mk Libs section, explain Avr\+Headers and Fake\+Avr\+Headers \mbox{[} \mbox{]} clean up messy conditional in kitnum
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item break this out to its own script?
\item want to use the same input validation in progkitnum \mbox{[} \mbox{]} clean up top-\/level files used for firmware programming \mbox{[} \mbox{]} should the kits folder be in the repo?
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{T\+O\+DO\+: progkitnum}

progkitnum fails when I run it from the Vim command line. The scan on line 28 works,


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{"\$ftdi" scan cycl '0'}
\end{DoxyCode}


then the subsequent scans fail


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{"\$ftdi" scan prog 0 ftcfg.xml cycl 0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ../..}
\DoxyCodeLine{"\$ftdi" scan}
\end{DoxyCode}


The failure message\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Scanning for devices...}
\DoxyCodeLine{No devices found!}
\DoxyCodeLine{Device 0 does not exist.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Index was out of range. Must be non-\/negative and less than the size of the collection.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Parameter name: index}
\DoxyCodeLine{Scanning for devices...}
\DoxyCodeLine{No devices found!}
\DoxyCodeLine{Double-\/check the serial number on the line above is 0911-\/21.}
\end{DoxyCode}


Why would this fail when I run it from Vim?
