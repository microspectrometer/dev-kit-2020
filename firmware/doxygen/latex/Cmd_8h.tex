\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Commands are described in doc \char`\"{}\+U\+S\+B\+Protocol\char`\"{}\+: a table showing the expected payload and responses (if any) for each command.

Each command is one byte. Firmware source code refers to this command byte as the {\ttfamily key}.

The user issues a command by sending the command byte ({\ttfamily key}) to the firmware. The firmware looks up the command {\ttfamily key} in a {\itshape jump table} and returns the function that performs that command. The {\itshape jump table} is just an {\bfseries{array of function pointers}}, one function for each command in \char`\"{}\+U\+S\+B\+Protocol\char`\"{}.

Firmware source code names both the {\bfseries{key}} and the {\bfseries{function}} with the command\textquotesingle{}s name\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the {\bfseries{key}} name is the command name with a {\ttfamily \+\_\+key} suffix
\item the {\bfseries{function}} name is simply the command name
\end{DoxyItemize}

T\+O\+DO\+: command lookup table replaced by switch-\/case block. Datatypes {\ttfamily cmd} and {\ttfamily Cmd} are not used. Delete this file and move the documentation somewhere else.
